The Below codes, sure is handy
```java
// if return type is List<Integer>
return Arrays.asList(a, b);
```
In 2D matrix, the below code is handy
```java
// for traversing and other element level operations
for (int[] rows : matrix) {
    for (int ele : rows) {
        sum += ele;
    }
}
```

Typical `git-cli` things,
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "" && git push origin main
```
